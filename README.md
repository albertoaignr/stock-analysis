# Stocks Analysis Template

In this challenge, we'll be helping Steve to analyze a stock market dataset with just a click, by means of Visual Basic for Aplications(VBA). 

##Overview of the project

Selecting and formatting the data to display the performance of the stocks in different years is done by coding variables and making conditions with the information on the cells. Also, we are going to determine the influence of refactoring a code, which is a readjustment for the computer to read it in a more efficient way, evaluating computing times. 

##Results 

This code is a complex of different conditions and variables, by using Cells values it can be done the display of the information we will be working on. Every time theres a sequence of similar code, it could mean a sense that it's a process that can be automated. In this case,

###Images and examples of code

Compare stock performance 2017 vs 2018 as well as execution times

From this tables, the formatting made it clear to see the performance of all the stocks, with a positive returns in ENPH and RUN for both years.

## Summary

###Advantages and disadvantages of refactoring a code

In general terms, refactoring a code could be very advantageous if its a repetitive process where a lot of data is taken into considetation, making an iterative code run through the information and saving up time to assing values. The counterside is that it might take time to analyze how the code can be improved, 

###How Pros/cons apply to refactoring the original code
